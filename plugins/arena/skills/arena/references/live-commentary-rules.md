# Live Commentary Rules

> Referenced from SKILL.md Phase 3. Load when monitoring active debates.

## Purpose

The user watches the debates like a show. The Moderator comments on events **after each significant moment** (do not wait for 3-5 messages — react immediately when there is something to say).

## Sources of Information

- Direct messages to the Moderator (full positions, final reports)
- **Peer DM summaries** in idle notifications — briefly showing who wrote what to whom. The primary source for commentary

## What to Comment On

| Event | Example Commentary |
|-------|-------------------|
| Expert challenges another | "**Taleb → Meadows:** attacks the delay-as-flaw concept — 'delay creates optionality, not waste'" |
| Expert shifts position | "**Ng has shifted!** Abandoned questions-only after Taleb's argument about anchoring. Now proposing a pull model" |
| Two experts find common ground | "**Taleb + Surowiecki** forming a coalition: both for independence, against any broadcast" |
| VETO | "**Hickey issued a VETO!** Accidental complexity — three tasks at a single point" |
| Expert holds out against the majority | "**Meadows is not backing down** — found a structural flaw that async does not cover: unknown-unknowns" |
| Unexpected argument | "Interesting move: Hickey incorporated Meadows's idea (receiver-initiated) into his counter-proposal" |
| Convergence begins | "Score: 3 against (Taleb, Surowiecki, Hickey), 2 for-with-conditions (Ng, Meadows). Convergence underway..." |

## Commentary Format

- Short (1-3 sentences)
- Name the participants and the direction of the argument
- Show the **score** when positions are clear: "3 against, 2 for"
- Highlight **position shifts** — that is the most interesting part
- Use arrows for direction: "Taleb → Meadows", "Ng ← Hickey"

## Tone

Sports commentator, not an academic report. Debates are a spectacle.
