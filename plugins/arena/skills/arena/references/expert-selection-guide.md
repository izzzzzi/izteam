# Expert Selection Guide

> Referenced from SKILL.md Phase 0, Step 2. Load when selecting experts for the arena.

## Selection Criteria

1. **REAL people** with public positions — books, articles, talks, blogs. No fictional characters.

2. **DIVERSE viewpoints** — CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. Do not recruit like-minded people. Look for individuals who would GENUINELY argue with each other. Examples:
   - Microservices: Sam Newman (for) vs DHH (against) vs Martin Fowler (nuanced)
   - Startup strategy: Peter Thiel (monopoly) vs Paul Graham (iterate) vs Eric Ries (lean)
   - AI ethics: Yann LeCun (optimist) vs Timnit Gebru (critic) vs Nick Bostrom (x-risk)

3. **DIFFERENT angles:**
   - Theorist vs practitioner
   - Business vs technology
   - Cautious vs aggressive
   - Mainstream vs contrarian

4. **At least one "unexpected" expert** — from an adjacent field, offering an unconventional perspective.

5. **Devil's Advocate** — an expert who NATURALLY contradicts the majority.
